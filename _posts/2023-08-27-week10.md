During this week I:
* completed a final machine learning assignment given to be my mentor. This assignment was about applying what I learned in the [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here) courses to predict if someone survived the Titanic based on given attributes about the person and their stay on the Titanic. The problem details and dataset are part of a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview)
* In Project 1: Suicide Prevention, assisted in the writing and scripts necessary for the next paper related to the project. In this paper, we will pair the suicidality prediction model with the LLaMA language generation model so that there are explanations for the predictions for a user. This paper will focus on prompt engineering, with how we tell LLaMA what the predicted level of risk is and guide it into an explanation for that prediction.
