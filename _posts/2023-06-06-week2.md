During this week I:
* fixed my broken anaconda installation. The relevant anaconda-clean package wasn't able to be installed because of issues with the base environment, so I learned about creating new environments.
* completed the first of 2 recommended mini-courses on [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here). The full title for this mini-course is "Python Machine Learning (scikit-learn)". The other relevant course will be completed next week. In this mini course, I learned how to:
    * creating a pandas.DataFrame from a CSV and how to specify a header row (if it exists).
    * use relevant pandas.DataFrame methods to get a peek of the data and a statistical summary per attribute of the data.
    * use matplotlib to display statistical plots like histograms.
    * use scikit-learn to create classification models of the data and evaluate their accuracy with visuals.
* finished the application to apply for funding to the 2023 Tapia Conference and 2023 Grace Hopper Conference. My mentor and I think these confereces can be great opportunities.
* gathered related work on Google Scholar to be read and considered for use in the Suicide Prevention project paper to be submitted to the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing \[EMNLP\].
