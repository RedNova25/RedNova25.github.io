During this week I:
* Completed a mini-course on [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here). The full title for this mini-course is "Weka Machine Learning (no code)". I learned how to use the Weka tool to understand and improve machine learning algorithms with tools like feature selection.
* In Project 1: Suicide Prevention, had knowledge transfer meetings with the two primary student researchers so that I can write the documentation.
* In Project 1, began work on the documentation for the entire project.
* In Project 2: Math Education App, met with [Victor](https://vtumbioloslick.github.io/) to set up GitHub for his animations.
