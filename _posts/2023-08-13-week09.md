During this week I:
* In Project 1: Suicide Prevention, continued work on the documentation for the entire project.
* In Project 1, I met with my research mentor Dr. Nur and a student researcher to discuss a new paper idea he had that builds on what we previously worked on. After this meeting, I am set to become a project manager and paper writer for that paper this Fall.
* Worked on my DREU Final Report and feedback survey.
