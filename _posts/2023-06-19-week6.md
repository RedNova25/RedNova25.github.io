During this week I:
* Wrote feedback for [Victor's](https://vtumbioloslick.github.io/) math education app (Project 3) that provides animations to clarify math concepts. I gave feedback on 10 animations, and I did my best to reference the documentation of the Java library he was using, and catch every detail. 
* Also in Project 3, Started writing the pre-survey concerning how high schoolers and college students think/thinked about their ability to understand of their high school math education, and post-survey for specific feedback about particular animations and the app in general.
