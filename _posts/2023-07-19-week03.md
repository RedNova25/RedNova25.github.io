During this week I: 
* Reviewed the "Python Machine Learning (scikit-learn)" course I completed last week to ensure I knew everything I needed to.
* Created a presentation detailing what I learned from the course last week.
* Got my DREU website up with posts for the first 2 weeks. I met with [Victor](https://vtumbioloslick.github.io/) for help because he has experience with web development.
* Gathered related work from Google Scholar for Project 1: Suicide Prevention.
