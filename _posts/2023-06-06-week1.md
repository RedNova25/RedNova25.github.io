During this week I:
* completed refresher exercises to re-familiarize myself where necessary with the Python language and relevant packages. I completed exercises at [https://learnpython.org](https://learnpython.org/). The sections I completed were
    * Classes and Objects
    * Modules and Packages
    * NumPy Arrays
    * Pandas Basics
* completed CITI ethical compliance training for research with human subjects.
* started the application to apply for funding to the 2023 Tapia Conference and 2023 Grace Hopper Conference. My mentor and I think these conferences can be great opportunities.
* used the Scholarcy Chrome extension to automatically generate summaries for the related work we have gathered for the Suicide Prevention project paper to be submitted to the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing \[EMNLP\].
