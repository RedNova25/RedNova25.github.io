During this week I:
* Completed refresher exercises to re-familiarize myself where necessary with the Python language and relevant packages. I completed exercises at [https://learnpython.org](https://learnpython.org/). The sections I completed were
    * Classes and Objects
    * Modules and Packages
    * NumPy Arrays
    * Pandas Basics
* Completed CITI ethical compliance training for research with human subjects.
* Started the application to apply for funding to the 2023 Tapia Conference and 2023 Grace Hopper Conference. My mentor and I think these conferences can be great opportunities.
* Used the Scholarcy Chrome extension to automatically generate summaries for the related work we have gathered for the Suicide Prevention project paper to be submitted to a 2023 conference.
